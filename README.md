## Welcome to unScrabble!
The goal of this project is to help me finally beat my partner at Scrabble by helping me cheat my way to the top! Just kidding üòè.

### Description
This project uses NextJs, a great framework for building scalable applications and
getting to production quickly, especially if you're willing to fork over the bucks
for vercel.

It also uses tailwindcss. Tailwind is a great library for quickly and easily styling
components. It takes a little bit of getting used to, but once you get the hang
of it, styling pages is quick and effortless. It can lead to extremely verbose
class names, which I'm not a fan of, but what is life if not a long series of trade-offs?
